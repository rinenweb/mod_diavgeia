# Diavgeia Module
A Joomla 4 module that is used for retrieving data from diavgeia.gov.gr based on defined rules.

## Features
Current settings include:
- [x] **Intro Text**, where you can write some text before that will be displayed before the decisions. You can even use some HTML markup there.
- [x] **Keywords to search**, where you fill in the desired keywords to search in Diavgeia.gov.gr
- [x] **Number of decisions to retrieve**, where you define the number of decisions to display. Remember that you can display up to 500 decisions, since you need to have credentials to search for more in Diavgeia.gov.gr
- [x] **Display Organization**, where you select whether you want the respected organization of each decision to be displayed
- [x] **Display ADA (with link)**, where you select whether you want the ADA of each decision to be displayed, which is hyperlinked to the respected decision page in Diavgeia.gov.gr

Other features include:
+ Language strings for **English** and **Greek** language. Feel free to find the relevant language constants in "language" folder and make a Language Override via Joomla if you wish.
+ Classes are present in both the intro text and the unordered list of the fetched decisions, that allow you to easily customize the module's CSS according to your needs. Also, remember that you can also write some HTML markup in the intro text field. 


## Requirements
Diavgeia Module will (hopefully) play nice with:
- [x] Joomla 4.X
- [X] Joomla 5.X
- [x] PHP 8.0+

> [!WARNING]
>This module will **NOT** work with Joomla 3.X or PHP 7.X.
